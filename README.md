Dollar Formatter
============

This is a simple function to format an input field to 0.00 format. 

I wrote this for a mobile project I was working on.  I needed to enter a dollar value and it was faster to enter the dollar value as a string of numerals without the decimal, and use javascript to add the decimal later. Some ATMs work this way.
